                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p class="companyText">Beer? Beer good! Beer wets mouth. Less thirsty humans make nicer friends. Having friends who are more content leads to improved conversation and an opportunity to expand one's vocabulary. Fulminate against mediocrity! Insist on the finer things in life and demand nothing less. As famed author Mark Twain once noted, "Beer good!"<br><br>
                <br>Massive wooden ramps were built all over London including sites at Wolesley Barracks, Western University, along the hames River near Ann St., which was the location of the original Carling Brewery, and as well beside the original and current Labatt Brewery. The most impressive ramp was a 485 foot long double chute, located across Victoria Park from us at Wellington and Central.<br><br>
                <br>It’s in this spirit of toboganning, where people from London and area come together to have fun and enjoy locally made beer and food, that we bring you the Toboggan Brewing Company.<br>

Having a small selection of flagship beers available all year round, but also offering an always-changing roster of seasonal beers as well as one-offs that might never be seen again.</p>

                      <h2>German Pilsner</h2>
                      <p class="productText">Unlike other straw-colored lagers, German pilsners have a notable sweetness from the malts used during the brewing process. They can contain a slight hop bitterness, which balances out the sweet flavors to finish crisp and refreshing. They are usually less than 5% alcohol by volume.</p>

                      <h2>Helles</h2>
                      <p class="productText">Helles German beers are perfect for hot, summer days! They’re light-colored and sweet like pilsners, but with a spicy hop presence and a fuller, more bread-like malt character. They tend to lean closer to 5.5% alcohol by volume.</p>

                      <h2>Dunkel</h2>
                      <p class="productText">These dark beers always surprise me! Although dunkels are dark in color, they’re smooth and easy drinking, thanks to the lager yeast they’re brewed with. They have almost no hop presence, but the malt flavors are deep and rich. Because they’re so light in flavor, they’re also light in alcohol; they settle in around 4 to 6%.</p>

                <p class="companyText">Come in for a drink and stay for a meal. Some kind words about the chef and the food they make would go great here. Perhaps the food is fresh? Local? Organically-vegan? Could be that the food is mainly greasy fare. Something more akin to a pub or bar than a bistro or eatery, perhaps.</p>
