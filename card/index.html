          <br><p>To my wonderful Fianc√©e,<br>
          Happy Valentine's Day My Love!!!<br>
          Eight(!) Valentine's's now! That's just two years from a decade... How the time flies!! I Love you sooo much!<br>
          Despite the major bummer that this past year has been in so many ways, it's never felt like it was something we couldn't get through. In fact, I feel like all this time 'stuck' together in the house has really allowed us to test the mettle of our relationship and I feel like I'm more in love with you now than ever! In some weird way it feels like we're here <em>surviving</em> something major together.<br>
          Thank you for being there to steady me as I transition to yet another new job. Your encouragement means the world to me and having you in my corner makes me feel like I can take on anything.<br>
          You're the sunshine that brightens up my every day.<br>
          With all of my love,<br>
          üíã‚ù§Ô∏è Kev ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã
